## The Tiny Challenge

This started as a personal challenge that I invented for myself to pass the time while on a plane. The idea is to create versions of classic games using 100 or fewer lines of JavaScript. No line can be longer than 140 characters. Performance, readability, space and time complexity are all fair game when it comes to making sacrifices in order to fit within 100 lines. HTML and CSS don't count against the limit, but need to be kept to an absolute bare minimum.
